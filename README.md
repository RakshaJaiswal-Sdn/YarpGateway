## Microservices Overview

In this project, I developed two microservices:

- **Patient Microservice**
- **Provider Microservice**

Each microservice exposes two **GET** APIs to retrieve relevant data.

## API Gateway with YARP

To manage and route requests between clients and these microservices, I implemented an **API Gateway** using **YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy)**.

**YARP** is a highly customizable and performant reverse proxy library developed by Microsoft. It is built on ASP.NET Core and designed to handle dynamic routing, load balancing, and request transformation with ease.

In this project, the API Gateway uses YARP to:

- Route incoming requests to the appropriate microservice
- Simplify client interaction by exposing a unified entry point
- Enhance scalability and separation of concerns in the microservices architecture
